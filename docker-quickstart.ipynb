    "\n",
    "Docker is a computer program that runs software packages called \"containers\". Containers bundle their own tools, libraries and configuration files. Containers allow users to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development or deployment. Containers are created from \"images\" that specify their precise contents."
